# UT Austin AI/ML Graduate Certificate Projects

This repository contains all of my projects completed as part of the UT Austin Graduate Certificate in AI and Machine Learning.

## Projects

- **Natural Language Processing:** Bank Personal Loan Campaign
  -  Developed an an AI-driven sentiment analysis system that will automatically process and analyze news articles to gauge market sentiment, and summarizing the news at a weekly level to enhance the accuracy of stock price predictions and optimize investment strategies.
  -  Used Word2Vec, GLoVe, and SentenceTransformers for embeddings, training a GradientBoosting model on each type, hyperparemter tuning with GridSearchCV, and evaluating performance.
  -  Used Mistral 7B LLM for weekly news summarization.
  - [Folder Link](./project2-neural-networks)
 
- **Neural Networks:** Bank Customer Churn Prediction
  - Built and trained TensorFlow/Keras neural network to predict customer churn within 6-month window. Fine-tuned model with combinations of SMOTE, SGD, Adam, and Dropout techniques.

- **Computer Vision:** Plant Seedling Classification
  - Built and trained a Convolutional Neural Network model to determine a plant's species from an image, using OpenCV and TensorFlow.

- **Advanced Machine Learning:** Credit Card Users Churn Prediction
  - XGBoost, AdaBoost, and GradientBoosting models, with hyperparameter tuning, and tuning with over/undersampled data, for credit card user churn prediction for a bank.
